            In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight
            however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because
            the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes
            to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth.
            The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.
